Sandra Marie Gibson (nee Shelley) died on September 8, 2021 at the age of 88 following complications from a heart attack.

She is survived by her children, her grandchildren, and their families:
* Shelley Selle (daughter)
* Dennis Gibson (son)
* Dale Gibson (son)
* Ryan Greget (grandson)
* Bradyn Gibson (grandson)

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no services will be held; the family will have a private celebration of life.  Sandra will be laid to rest next to her late husband at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, CA.
In lieu of flowers, the family ask that donations be made in Sandra’s memory to the [Children’s Hunger Fund](https://childrenshungerfund.org/){:target="\_blank"}.

Sandra was born in Denver, CO on November 28, 1932 to Virgil and Gladys Shelley, their only child.  The family eventually moved to California where Sandra graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1950.  After high school, she attended college where she studied art before marrying Richard H. Gibson on November 20, 1951.  Sandra and Richard raised their three children together in Northridge, CA until Richard’s death in October of 1976 from cancer.  Sandra continued living in Northridge and would eventually spend over 60 years of her life there.  She was an outgoing woman with many friends and social commitments.  

She was a believer in community.  She previously served as president of the Northridge Junior Women’s Club and also worked as a docent at both The Getty and the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History.

Her interests in life were many and varied.  She loved traveling abroad and did so often.  She was a lifelong yoga enthusiast and also enjoyed square dancing.  Her love of art extended to music; she played the guitar and was often sang folk songs.  Sandra was a voracious reader of books and an avid animal lover.

Sandra spent the last few years of her life living in the Prescott, AZ area, close to all of her children.  She will be missed dearly by all those that knew her, and she will be remembered for her outgoing personality, generous spirit, and her love of the world.
